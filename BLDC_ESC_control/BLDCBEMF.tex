\subsection{FOC and the BEMF waveform}
It is often stated that FOC is for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM) and six-step commutation is for BLDC motors. This is because PMSMs would have a more sinusoidal BEMF compared to a more trapezoidal BEMF for BLDC motors due to the layout of the stator windings.

\autoref{fig:BLDC_BEMF_GND_Ref} shows the BEMF (measured with the ground rail as reference as seen in \autoref{fig:BLHeli_ESC_Test_Connection}) when rotating the motor by hand. What is interesting to see is that the BEMF is indeed somewhat trapezoidal but has two 'bumps' on the top and bottom of their waveform. These bumps disappear as the motor slows down and the BEMF becomes more sinusoidal.

When measuring the BEMF from the same motor but using another phase as the reference (see \autoref{fig:BLDC_BEMF_Phase_Ref_Setup}) the BEMF looks more sinusoidal as seen in \autoref{fig:BLDC_BEMF_Phase_Ref}.

The waveform seen in \autoref{fig:BLDC_BEMF_Phase_Ref} is simply the difference between the two phases (like you would expect) as can be shown with the math function of the oscilloscope in \autoref{fig:BLDC_BEMF_Phase_Ref_difference}. The math function is executed on waveforms similar to the ones shown in \autoref{fig:BLDC_BEMF_GND_Ref}.
